# WizardGame 2

My game project for my "Designing Object Oriented Applications" (in Romanian "Proiectarea
aplica»õiilor orientate obiect") course.

I wrote a report about it (in Romanian), you can see the $\LaTeX$ source code in the
[report](./report/) folder.

You can see the repository as it was on the day I submitted it for grading at commit [TO BE FILLED IN].

## Building

I used IDEA as a "build system", so that is the easiest way to build the game, however you will
also need an sqlite3 JDBC driver jar (IDEA expects it to be named `sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2.jar`, and in
the root, our professor provided us with [this link](https://jar-download.com/artifacts/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.8.11.2/source-code))
and [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) (IDEA expects it to be named `gson-2.10.1.jar`).
